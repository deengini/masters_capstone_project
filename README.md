# **A Systematic Review of the Impact of Digital Health Technology on Communicable Diseases Outcomes in Africa**

## **Project Description**

This project was submitted as the final applied project and thesis for a master's degree in Health Informatics. It is a culmination of more than 3 months of comprehensive research and edits. 

## **Abstract**

* **Background:** Despite the efforts of policymakers and stakeholders, major communicable diseases such as HIV, malaria, lower respiratory infections (LRTIs) and diarrheal illnesses still contribute significantly to mortality rates in African. HIV resulted in 435,000 deaths and is more prevalent in the southern region of Africa. Malaria resulted in 388,000 deaths and was more prevalent in Nigeria and Democratic Republic of Congo. LRTIs resulted in 774,000 deaths and were more prevalent in Central African Republic and Somalia. Finally, diarrheal illnesses resulted in 496,000 deaths and were more prevalent in western region of Africa.

* **Objective:** The purpose of this systematic literature review is to identify quantitative studies on the impact of digital health technologies on the health outcomes of HIV, malaria, lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) and diarrheal diseases in African countries. 

* **Methods:** A systematic literature review was conducted by extracting data from the following databases: CINAHL, Scopus, PubMed, Pan-African Clinical Trials registry and African Medical Indicus. The keywords used for research in this review were malaria, HIV, diarrhea, LRTIs, telemedicine, mHealth, eHealth and Africa. The search terms used were slightly different for each database. Titles, abstracts, and full texts of the studies were screened along with a quality assessment of the articles. A narrative analysis was then used to synthesize the information into developing themes.

* **Results:** The research gave 1051 hits, and 23 studies were identified based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. SMS messages were the most common form of digital health technology while most of the studies in this review were conducted in Kenya. For impact of digital health technology, ten studies identified impact on HIV, ten studies identified impact on LRTIs, five studies identified on malaria while four studies identified impact on diarrhea. 

* **Conclusions:** This review shows that digital health technology have a mixed impact on the health outcomes of HIV, malaria, LRTIs and diarrheal diseases in Africa. It also shows that SMS messages were the most common form of digital health technology, and that digital health technology was mostly implemented in Sub-Saharan countries like Kenya and South Africa.
